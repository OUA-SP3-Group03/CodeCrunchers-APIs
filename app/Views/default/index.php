<h1>Welcome to Code Crunchers!</h1>
<p style="color: white"> In Code Crunchers, you play as a first year programming
    student with no prior coding experience who must progress through 3 stages of
    programming. But this is no ordinary programming course! You will need to navigate
    through increasingly tricky levels and defeat enemies using your coding weapons, but
    beware – the dreaded Master of Bad Coding lies in wait to challenge any would-be
    programmers! Collect power ups by defeating enemies to help you progress and
    defeat the Master, or try to complete the game as quickly as possible to earn a high
    score!</p>

    <p style="color: white">Code Crunchers functions as a side-scrolling action game: the player needs to
        progress through a series of increasingly difficult levels, each populated with a different
        layouts and selection of enemies, with the aim of reaching and defeating the final boss
        at the final game level. The player has the ability to move left and right, jump over
        obstacles or between platforms, and shoot their weapon to defeat enemies. Enemies
        may drop ‘power ups’ which will improve the player’s weapon damage or movement
        and help them progress through the game. The game will record the player’s score,
        and allow them to save their scores for sharing.</p>
